# Introduction to TCP/IP Networking
## TCP/IP Networking Model
TCP/IP Model :
* Application {HTTP, POP3, SMTP}
* Transport  {TCP, UDP}
* Network  {IP, ICMP}
* Data Link  {Ethernet, 802.11}
* Physical

### TCP/IP Transport Layer
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
#### TCP Error Recovery Basics
TCP includes an <b>error-recovery</b> feature. To recover from errors, TCP uses the concept of acknowledgments
#### Same-Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions
* Adjacent-layer interaction refers to the concepts of how adjacent layers in a networking model, on the same computer, work together.For example, the higher-layer protocol (HTTP) wants error recovery, so it uses the next lower-layer protocol (TCP) to perform the service of error recovery; the lower layer provides a service to the layer above it.
* Same-layer interaction is when a particular layer on one computer wants to communicate with the same layer on another computer, the two computers use headers to hold the information that they want to communicate.
