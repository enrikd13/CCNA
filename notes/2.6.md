 sticky secure MAC addresses - port security learns the MAC addresses off each port so that you do not have to preconfigure the values
## Configuring Port Security 

 1. <code>switchport mode access</code> or the <code>switchport mode trunk</code>
 2. <code>switchport port-security</code>
 3. <code>switchport port-security maximum number</code> interface subcommand to override the default maximum number of allowed MAC
 4. <code>switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict | shutdown}</code> interface subcommand to override the default action
 5.  <code>switchport port-security mac-address mac-address</code>
 6. <code>switchport port-security mac-address sticky</code>

 * default maximum source address setting of 1
 * Port security does not save the configuration of the sticky addresses, so use the copy running-config startup-config

## Verifying Port Security 

 <code># show port-security interface fastEthernet 0/1</code>

 with port security, the switch no longer considers MAC addresses associated with that port as being dynamic entries as listed with the <code>show mac address-table dynamic</code> EXEC command

* <code>show mac address-table secure</code>: Lists MAC addresses associated with ports that use port security
* <code>show mac address-table static</code>: Lists MAC addresses associated with ports that use port
security, as well as any other statically defined MAC addresses

## Port Security Violation Modes


 | <code>switchport port-security violation {}</code>  | Protect  | Restrict  | Shutdown  |  
|---|---|---|---|
| Discards offending traffic  | X  | X  | X  |  
| Sends log and SNMP messages  | -  | X  | X  |  
| Disables the interface by putting it in an err-disabled state, discarding all traffic  | -  | -  | X  |
||||.|

* <code>errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation</code>: A global command to enable automatic recovery for interfaces in an err-disabled state caused by port security
* <code>errdisable recovery interval seconds</code>: A global command to set the time to wait before
recovering the interface
