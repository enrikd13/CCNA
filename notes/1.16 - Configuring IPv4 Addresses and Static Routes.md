# Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes

## IP Routing
default gateway and default router

The router receives a frame, removes the packet from inside the frame, decides where to forward the packet, puts the packet into another frame, and sends the frame.

The router uses the data-link trailer’s FCS field to check the frame, and if errors occurred in transmission, the
router discards the frame. (The router makes no attempt at error recovery;

Frames sent to the router’s unicast MAC address for that interface are clearly sent to that router. However, a router can actually receive a frame sent to some other unicast MAC address, and routers should ignore these frames.

## Configuring IP Addresses and Connected Routes
* <b>Connected routes</b>: Added because of the configuration of the ip address interface subcommand on the local router 
* <b>Static routes</b>: Added because of the configuration of the ip route global command on the local router 
* <b>Routing protocols</b>: Added as a function by configuration on all routers, resulting in a process by which routers dynamically tell each other about the network so that they all learn routes


router automatically adds a route to its routing table for the subnet connected to each interface as long as :
* The interface is in a working state , line status of up and a protocol status of up.
*  interface has an IP address assigned through the ip address interface subcommand.

<code># show ip route</code> command, which lists these routes with a c as the route code, meaning connected.
