# Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting
## Introduction to Subnetting
- Addresses in the same subnet are not separated by a router. 
- Addresses in different subnets are separated by at least one router.

one subnet for every 
- VLAN 
- Point-to-point serial link
- Ethernet WAN (Ethernet Line Service)


 2^h â€“ 2 hosts (usable IP addresses).  Each subnet reserves the numerically lowest value for the subnet number and the numerically highest value as the subnet broadcast address.

variable-length subnet masks (VLSM)
