# Wan Architecture (Not finished)
## Metro Ethernet  (MetroE)
Service that uses Ethernet physical links to connect the customer’s device to the service provider’s device. The service is a Layer 2 service in that the WAN provider forwards Ethernet frames from one customer device to another.

SP needs to build a network to create the Metro Ethernet service. To keep costs lower the SP puts a device (typically an Ethernet switch) physically near to as many customer sites as possible, in an SP facility called a <b>point of presence (PoP)</b>. The physical link between the customer and the SP is called an <b>access link</b> or, when using Ethernet specifically, an Ethernet access link. Everything that happens on that link falls within the definition of the <b>user network interface, or UNI</b>.

|MEF Service Name|MEF Short Name|Topology|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Ethernet Line Service|E-Line|Point-to-point|Two customer premise equipment (CPE) devices can exchange Ethernet frames, similar in concept to a leased line.|
|Ethernet LAN Service|E-LAN|Full mesh|Acts like a LAN; all devices can send frames to all other devices.|
|Ethernet Tree Service|E-Tree|Hub and spoke; partial mesh; point-to-multipoint|A central site can communicate to a defined set of remote sites, but the remote sites cannot communicate directly.|


## Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
MPLS creates a WAN service that routes IP packets between customer sites. The enterprise deploys routers and switches as usual. The SP then creates its own IP network, spanning a large geographic area. Issues arise when supporting multiple customers that use the same private IP network.

<b>label switching</b>: the routers on the edge of the MPLS network add and remove an MPLS header to packets as they enter and exit the MPLS network. The devices inside the MPLS network then use the label field inside that MPLS header when forwarding data across the MPLS network. The choices of the labels to use, along with other related logic, allow the MPLS VPN to create separate VPNs to keep different customers’ traffic separate.
