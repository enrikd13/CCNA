# Implementing DHCP

<code> ip helper-address server-ip</code>

* <b>Discover</b>: Sent by the DHCP client to find a willing DHCP server 
* <b>Offer</b>: Sent by a DHCP server to offer to lease to that client a specific IP address (and inform the client of its other parameters) 
* <b>Request</b>: Sent by the DHCP client to ask the server to lease the IPv4 address listed in the Offer message 
* <b>Acknowledgment</b>: Sent by the DHCP server to assign the address and to list the mask,default router, and DNS server IP addresses

## DHCP Server
* Subnet ID and mask
* Reserved (excluded) addresses:
* Default router(s)
* DNS IP address(es
### Allocation modes :
* <b>Dynamic allocation</b>
* <b>Automatic allocation</b> : DHCP lease time to infinite
* <b>Static allocation</b> : preconfigures the specific IP address for a client based on the clientâ€™s MAC address

## DHCP Client 
<code>(config-if)# ip address dhcp</code><br>
<code># show dhcp lease</code><br>
<code># show ip default-gateway</code>

* Routers turn the default gateway IP address into the basis for a default route.
