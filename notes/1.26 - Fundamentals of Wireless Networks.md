# Fundamentals of Wireless Networks
## Wireless LAN Topologies
IEEE 802.11 WLANs are always half duplex because transmissions between stations use the same frequency or channel.  To achieve full-duplex mode, one station’s transmission would have to occur on one frequency while it receives over a different frequency—much like full-duplex Ethernet links work. Although this is certainly possible and practical, the 802.11 standarddoes not permit full-duplex operation

### Basic Service Set
Before a device can participate, it must advertise its capabilities and then be granted permission to join. The 802.11 standard calls this a <b>basic service set (BSS)</b>. At the heart of every BSS is a <b>wireless access point (AP)</b>. The AP operates in infrastructure mode, which means it offers the services that are necessary to form the infrastructure of a wireless network. The AP also establishes its BSS over a single wireless channel. The AP and the members of the BSS must all use the same channel to communicate properly.
Because the operation of a BSS hinges on the AP, the BSS is bounded by the area where the AP’s signal is usable. This is known as the <b>basic service area (BSA)</b> or cell.

The AP serves as a single point of contact for every device that wants to use the BSS. It advertises the existence of the BSS so that devices can find it and try to join. To do that, the AP uses a unique <b>BSS identifier (BSSID)</b> that is based on the AP’s own radio MAC address.

AP advertises the wireless network with a <b>Service Set Identifier (SSID)</b>, which is a text string containing a logical name.
Membership with the BSS is called an <i>association</i> Once associated, a device becomes a client, or an 802.11 station (STA), of the BSS.
