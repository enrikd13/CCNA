# Analyzing Subnet Masks

The subnet mask subdivides the IP addresses in a subnet into two parts: the prefix, or subnet part, and the host part.

Classful addressing means that you think about Class A, B, and C rules, so the prefix is separated into the network and subnet parts. 

Classless addressing means that you ignore the Class A, B, and C rules and treat the prefix part as one part.

Hosts in the subnet: 2^H â€“ 2, where H is the number of host bits. 

Subnets in the network: 2^S, where S is the number of subnet bits. Only use this formula if only one mask is used throughout the network.
